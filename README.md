# Tabbycat Data Importer

The scripts are basically using the Tabbycat API and Pandas to read through XLSX files and post them to the Tabbycat Database for quicker and effortless data importing. Best for bigger tournaments. Its written in python so easily editable by anyone. 

1. Use the Windows Executable folder if you wanna just run it on windows. 
2. Edit the Database.xlsx file with the data for your tournament. 
3. REMEMBER TO FILL THE LAST LINE WITH **DONE** SO THAT THE SCRIPT WORKS PROPERLY. 

PEACE!!!
